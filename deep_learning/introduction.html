Machine Learning(ML)

<ul>
<li>
is an algorithm that works on consequently through experience and by the utilization of information

<li>
It is viewed as a piece of AI

<li>
ML calculation assemble a model dependent on example information(Data), known as "training Data or information", to settle on forecasts or choices without being unequivolcally customized to do as such

</ul>
<li>
Fundamentals of ANN

<ul>
<li>
Neural computing is an information processing paradigm, inspired by biological system, composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements(neurons) working in unison to solve specific problems.
